Pipeline:

1)Noise were removed in the proposed manner:
    i.  Select features with skewness between -1 and 1
    ii. Select features with kurtosis between -1 and 1
    (This results in features that are approximately gausian for given sample space

2)here 2 hypothesis has been tested and depending on p=0.05 confidence features were selected


Subsequently t-SNE were plotted to find significance of gender.(Not really necessary for the pipeline)

Follwed by generation of binary and trinary combination of features.
